Technical Objectives & Skills Developed
The Shop Queue Simulator project is designed with the following technical objectives in mind:

1️⃣ Understanding and Implementing Multi-Threading
The project models a real-world queue system where multiple customers and cashiers operate simultaneously.
Uses Java Threads to simulate concurrency, ensuring that multiple customers are served in parallel.
Teaches concepts like:
Thread synchronization
Race conditions and thread safety
Efficient multi-threading for queue management

2️⃣ Simulation of Queue Management
Models different queueing strategies (FIFO, priority-based).
Helps in understanding queue discipline and customer behavior in a retail environment.
Enhances skills in event-driven programming and real-time system design.

3️⃣ Improving Performance with Synchronization & Locks
Uses synchronized blocks and locks to avoid conflicts when multiple threads access shared resources.
Helps in avoiding deadlocks and ensuring fair execution among customer threads.

4️⃣ Working with Event Logging & File Handling
Implements real-time event logging for simulation tracking.
Develops skills in file I/O handling for writing logs, saving results, and debugging.

5️⃣ Strengthening Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Skills
Uses classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to model customers, cashiers, and queue management.
Improves design thinking by implementing modular and reusable code.

6️⃣ Experimenting with Performance Optimization
Encourages experimenting with:
Different queueing policies
Adjusting thread priorities
Optimizing thread pool sizes
Helps in understanding real-world trade-offs between performance and fairness in queue systems.
